      <p>I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it’s a comedy My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face. She told me I had a purpose: to bring laughter and joy to the world The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t Weak minds sink under prosperity as well as adversity; but strong and deep ones have two high tides Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better</p>

      <p>I don't know what it was that bent your life out of shape, but who knows? Maybe I've been there too. Maybe I can help. We could work together. I could rehabilitate you. You needn't be out there on the edge anymore. You needn't be alone. We don't have to kill each other. What do you say?</p>
